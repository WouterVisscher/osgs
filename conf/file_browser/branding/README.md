The directory layout for branding is described here:

https://filebrowser.org/configuration/custom-branding

Also the default icons and logo can be found here if you want to copy them into your custom template as a starting point:

https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/master/frontend/public/img/icons

https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/master/frontend/public/img



For branding to take effect the branding resources need to be referenced in settings. We put them in /branding in the docker image.
