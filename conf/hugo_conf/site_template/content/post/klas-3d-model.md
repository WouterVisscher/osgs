**A great article by Klas Karlsson on how to create 3D models for QGIS from real world buildings.**

 
Klas' [article](https://geosupportsystem.se/2021/11/29/3d-modeller-fran-foton/) is in Swedish but the screenshots and description should be enough to get you started building 3D models of buildings.
